== Problem Statement ==

Create a SOAP based Web Service and Client, showing the WSDL and demonstrating the serice working.

Try to be more innovative than hello world for better marks. You could look on the internet and see if you could incorporate any existing XML based Web Service.

[Tutorials here](http://www.java2blog.com/2013/03/soap-web-service-example-in-java-using.html) for how to do it with Eclipse. It is easy to find more on the net, also check youtube videos.

You are **not** restricted to using Eclipse/Java/Glassfish. You might use Visual Studio and IIS, but it **must** be a SOAP based web service, you **must** have a WSDL file to show and you must demonstrate it working.
